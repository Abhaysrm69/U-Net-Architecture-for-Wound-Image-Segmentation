# README: U-Net Data Generator and Model Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a data generator and U-Net model for image segmentation tasks. The code utilizes TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and other Python libraries for deep learning and image preprocessing. The primary components include:

- **Data Generator**: Efficiently preprocesses and augments images and corresponding masks for training and testing.
- **U-Net Model**: A convolutional neural network architecture designed for image segmentation.

---

## Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed in your environment:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `tensorflow`
- `tqdm`

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python tensorflow tqdm
```

---

## Code Components

### 1. Parameters
- **Image Dimensions**: Images and masks are resized to `256x256` pixels.
- **Batch Size**: Set to 16 for efficient training.

```python
IMG_HEIGHT = 256
IMG_WIDTH = 256
BATCH_SIZE = 16
```

### 2. Data Generator
The `DataGenerator` class processes images and masks:
- Resizes images and masks.
- Normalizes pixel values to `[0, 1]`.
- Augments data using random flips and rotations (optional).

#### Example Usage:
```python
train_generator = DataGenerator(train_images, train_masks, BATCH_SIZE, IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH, augment=True)
test_generator = DataGenerator(test_images, test_masks, BATCH_SIZE, IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH)
```

---

### 3. U-Net Model
The `unet_model` function defines the U-Net architecture:
- **Encoder**: Downsamples the input image using convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Bridge**: Connects encoder and decoder with deeper convolutional layers.
- **Decoder**: Upsamples and reconstructs the segmented output.
- **Output**: A single-channel sigmoid layer for binary segmentation.

#### Example Usage:
```python
model = unet_model()
model.summary()
```

---

## How to Run
1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Organize images and masks in separate directories.
   - Split into training and testing sets.
2. Modify the paths to your datasets in the code.
3. Train the model:
   ```python
   model.fit(train_generator, validation_data=test_generator, epochs=25)
   ```

---

## Augmentation Details
The data generator performs optional augmentations to improve generalization:
- Random horizontal and vertical flips.
- Random rotations (up to ±15°).

---

## Model Summary
The model has ~31 million trainable parameters. It is well-suited for tasks like medical image segmentation, satellite imagery, etc.

---

## Example Applications
- **Medical Imaging**: Segmenting tumors or organs.
- **Satellite Imagery**: Land cover classification.
- **Industrial Use Cases**: Detecting defects or objects.
